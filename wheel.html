        <h1>Durometer</h1>
        <p>Durometer refers to the measured hardness of the wheel. Wheels come in the range of 78a-103a. When <br>
        choosing the wheel durometer, consider how you plan to skate the most - as wheel hardness affects the ride greatly.

        <h1>Contact Patch</h1>
        <p>
            Generally, wheels with a wider contact patch exhibit more grip and stability while <br>
            wheels with smaller contact patches slide more easily. It is common for softer wheels <br>
            (cruiser and filmer wheels) to have a wider patch to give the most stable ride possible.<br>
            On the other hand, on most street and park wheels of higher durometers, contact patch is <br>
            affected by the shape of the wheel - though they often come with a narrow contact patch. <br>
            This allows for easier slides (less grip) and pivots.
