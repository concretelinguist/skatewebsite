        <h3>How Raemers impacted my life</h3>
        <p>I remember searching for youtube tutorials on a trick called the "boneless". I came across Ben Raemer's tutorial and he seemed to have an easy-going attitude and a good sense of humor. While practicing my boneless, I would refer back to his video. His flow made everything look smooth and easy. </p>
